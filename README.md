# GBTL (Grizzly Byte Template Library)
This is a template library providing standard non-conforming utility functions and data structures.
This is explicitly NOT a standard library. For instance std::vector is a dynamic array where as gbtl::vector is mathematical vector.
 Please refer to the inline doxygen documentation for more information.<br>
However it works well in combination with the standard library and is partially based on it. A lot but not all of the methods are named according to the standard library. Again, refer to the documentation.<br>
For information on what algorithms and data structures are provided, please refer to the following list of feature progress:
- Linked List (70%)
- (Mathematical) Matrix (0%)
- (Mathematical) Vector (0%)
